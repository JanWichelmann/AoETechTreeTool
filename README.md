## OVERVIEW

This is an editor for the new implementation of the ingame tech tree view (F2). It provides a simple user interface where tree nodes can be added, edited and deleted. There are also functions to import and export the new tech tree data, so these can be easily applied to existing DAT files. The new tech tree data structure is incompatible to the existing one, so other DAT editing tools probably won't be able to read it.

For the new ingame tech tree implementation look here: https://github.com/Janworks/AoETechTree

## USAGE

Simply load the DAT file (usually empires2_x1_p1.dat) and select language files for proper string display (usually LANGUAGE.DLL, language_x1.dll and language_x1_p1.dll). If the DAT file already contains new tech tree information, these are displayed, else the tree view will be empty. You can add, delete and move nodes using the buttons on the right. To add a new top level node, press shift key while clicking "Add". Drag&Drop is also enabled.

There may still be a few bugs, so let me know if you run into problems.
